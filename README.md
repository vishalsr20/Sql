# Learning MySQL ðŸš€

This repository is my personal journey into learning **MySQL**.  
Here Iâ€™ll keep notes, SQL scripts, and resources that I use while practicing databases.

## ðŸ“Œ What Iâ€™m Learning
- Basics of SQL (CREATE, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Database schema design
- Relationships (One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many)
- Constraints (PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, NOT NULL)
- Joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN)
- Functions and Aggregations (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX)
- Subqueries and Nested Queries
- Indexing and Optimization
- Exporting & Importing databases with `mysqldump`
